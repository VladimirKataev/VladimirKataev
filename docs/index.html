  Hello there. I am Vladimir Kataev, a data science student with significant C++ expertise.
  Currently, I am studying at UC Riverside. I am excited to apply my current skills, and to acquire more.

  This website is here for a few purposes:
  <ol style="text-align:left;">
    <li> To be a quick note for when someone asks to see a website
    </li>

    <li> To show some of my technical skills to whoever is interested
    </li>

    <li> To be a quick revision note for how some per-language features operate
    </li>
  </ol>

  Major side note: While I like to think of myself as creative, I am far from artistic.
  And this website was hand-written with CSS and HTML. Which are NOT my specialty. Which is why it looks bad.
  Please read the contents of the articles while ignoring the bad styling.
