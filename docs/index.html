  Hello there. I am Vladimir Kataev, a data science student with significant C++ expertise.
  Currently, I am studying at UC Riverside. I am excited to apply my current skills, and to acquire more.

  This website is here for a few purposes:
  <ol style="text-align:left;">
    <li> To be a shorthand for a couple of equations and concepts I'll inevitably need later
    </li>

    <li> To show some of my techincal skills to whoever is interested.
    </li>

    <li> My friends tend to have an annoying habbit of being wrong. So a chunk here is to empirically disprove them.
    </li>
  </ol>

  Major side note: While I like to think of myself as creative, I am far from artistic.
  And this website was hand-written with CSS and HTML. Which are NOT my specialty. Which is why it looks bad.
  Please read the contents of the article while ignoring the bad styling.
